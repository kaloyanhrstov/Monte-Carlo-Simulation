Monte Carlo simulation, or Monte Carlo methods, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. In a few words, the purpose of Monte Carlo is to simulate a real life experiment that depends on randomness to some extent. Monte Carlo simulation is widely used across various industries. Some areas of application include:

* Physical sciences
* Engineering
* Artificial intelligence for games
* Computer graphics
* Finance and business
* Law
In this documentation (Monte Carlo Simulation.ipynb file), I will show you two examples of Monte Carlo simulation (Finance and business, Artificial intelligence for games).
